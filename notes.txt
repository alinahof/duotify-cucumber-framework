For Cucumber framework we will need the following 3 dependencies:
cucumber-java, cucumber-core, cucumber-junit

In Cucumber framework:
  - the test scenarios are put in a feature file which are usually are created under resources folder
  - the feature file scenario steps are connected to step definitions through @CucumberOptions "glue" option in Runner class
  - Cucumber scenario step is matched to step definition method using the text of the scenario step either with Regular Expressions or Cucumber Expressions
  - tags are the main way to control what scenario or feature files
  - Background -> the common steps for ALL scenarios of a feature file can be moved to Background steps
  - Hooks -> Step definition methods annotated with @Before and @After that are executed before/after each SCENARIO
          The annotated methods can be added into any class under Step Definitions folder but usually added into a separate class called Hooks


  Cucumber parametrized step enables the step to be used multiple times with different sets of data and prevents multiple step snippet generation

  Cucumber automatically converts matching types (String, int,double) from scenario step into corresponding parameter({string},{int},{double}) and adds it to a snippet method as a parameter:
  Ex:
      Scenario Step:           Given I have 5 pounds of cucumbers of type "Cuke" that cost me 5.99 dollars

      Generated snippet:        @Given("I have {int} pounds of cucumbers of type {string} that cost me {double} dollars")
                                public void i_have_pounds_of_cucumbers_of_type_that_cost_me_dollars(Integer int1, String string, Double double1) {

                                }

 If you need to specify information in a scenario that won't fit on a single line, you can use a DocString. (""" """)
       When you use a doctring make sure to put each triple quote on its own line.
       Ex: Scenario: Example scenario for Database
           When I send the following query
             """
                select first_name,last_name,email,address,district,city,country from customer
                join address
                on customer.address_id = address.address_id
                join city
                on address.city_id  = city.city_id
                join country
                on city.country_id = country.country_id;
              """


What are some common Cucumber exceptions?

           UndefinedStepException -  when a scenario step does not have matching step definition method

           PendingException - default exception that added to each step definition snippet

           DuplicateStepDefinitionException - happens when there are more than one step definitions with the exactly matching text

           AmbiguousStepDefinitionsException - this happens when one step has more than one matching step definitions due to parameters
                                     {string} and {word}

           CucumberException: Could not convert arguments for step [I pass this information] defined at - happens when setep definition parameter
                              type does not match the datatable
